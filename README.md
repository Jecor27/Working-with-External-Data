introduction to using the Cat Api
Created an async function "initialLoad" that does the following: [ ] Retrieve a list of breeds from the cat API using fetch(). [ ] Create new for each of these breeds, and append them to breedSelect. [ ] Each option should have a value attribute equal to the id of the breed. [ ] Each option should display text equal to the name of the breed. [ ] This function should execute immediately.
